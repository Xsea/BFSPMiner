# BFSPMiner
The code for the BFSPMiner algorithm as described in "BFSPMiner: An Effective and Efficient Batch-Free Algorithm for Mining Sequential Patterns over Data Streams"
The algorithm is able create sequential patterns out of a data stream. Additionally, it can use those created patterns to predict new events in the stream.

# Getting Started
If you want to use the algorithm, feel free to pull the project. Since it is a maven project you can either use it in your IDE, or package it and use the .jar
The code contains a Main class with two different example methods. One method explains how to generate and output sequential patterns. 
The second shows how to use sequential patterns for prediction. Simply choose your method in the code and run the main method to see some results.
